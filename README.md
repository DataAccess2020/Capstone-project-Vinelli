## *Electoral success of Green parties at European elections. A comparative analysis*
Given the 2019 European elections, Green parties have been described as ["big winners"](https://www.ft.com/content/56183ac6-807a-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849) (Brunsden, Financial Times, 2019) with an unprecedented result. Starting from what has been described in literature as "niche parties" (Meguid, 2005) and from the distinction between "first-order" and "second-order" elections (Reif, Schmitt, 1980), this project aims to try to answer to the following question: Is there a relation between the specific type of party, that is Greens, and the type of election, that is European? To understand better about the possible aspects underlying the Ecologist parties result, data from the ParlGov database (DÃ¶ring and Manow 2019) have been used to compare European and National elections over time.
